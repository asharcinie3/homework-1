                <h2>Ashley Arciniega</h2>   
                <p>I'm nearing the completion of my studies at Michigan State University, where I've pursued dual bachelor's degrees—one in Computer Science from the College of Engineering and another in Media and Information from the College of Communication Arts. My educational journey has been a transformative one, leading me to discover a passion that lies at the intersection of technology and creativity: front-end development and UI/UX design.</p>
                <p>While my coursework in Computer Science has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of coding principles and algorithms, it was my exploration of front-end development that truly captivated me. What sets front-end development apart is its perfect mesh of technical precision and creative expression. It's where I found the ideal platform to channel my coding skills while indulging my passion for design.</p>
                <p>As I prepare to transition into the professional realm, I'm excited about the prospect of continuing to explore the dynamic landscape of front-end development and UI/UX design. I'm drawn to roles that value innovation and collaboration, where I can leverage my unique blend of technical expertise and creative flair to make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Alongside my passion for front-end development and UI/UX design, there's a cool side to me—I'm a total cartoon enthusiast. Drawing cartoons and animated characters is my happy place outside the world of coding. While I'm all about crafting sleek interfaces, there's something about doodling cartoons that makes my days better. Whether I'm sketching out wireframes or brainstorming design ideas, my love for drawing injects a playful energy into every project I tackle.</p>
